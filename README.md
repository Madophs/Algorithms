# Algorithms in C++
This is my own implementation of algorithms that I'm learning. I'll be adding algos from different categories from Math to Graphs, etc... in no specific order. Most if not all the algorithms will be implemented in headers files (for easy testing) this repo isn't intented to be an algo lib.

## Build
1. Create a build directory ``mkdir build``
2. Generate sources ``cmake -S . -B build``
3. Build the project ``cmake --build build``
4. Execute tests ``cd build && ctest``

Feel free to come with new ideas, collaborate or improve existing algorithms, all contributions are appreciated.
